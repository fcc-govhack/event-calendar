Event Calendar

The way community events are currently presented to the public is unengaging, for example on the 'What's On' page for Logan City Council consists only of text. Our project will display lifestyle and leisure activities information together in a way that is easy to use and will help everyone find the information relevant to them.

Our project aims to make information regarding community events accessible to residents, tourists and anyone else new to the area. This will encourage community engagement, increase cultural awareness through promoting various cultural events and encourage livability within local communities.
